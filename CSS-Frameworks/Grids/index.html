          In the documentation, you may have noticed .col classes with
          additional text next to them. When a number follows a column, as in
          .col-4, it defines the size of the column. Recall that the grid system
          is typically based on 12 columns. The .col-4 class means that the
          selected element will take up 4 out of the 12 columns. Any columns
          with a .col class will equally share the rest of the space. In the
          following Repl.it, the first column is set to .col-9.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col col-lg-6 border">
        <p>
          Similarly, it's possible to make your columns and rows responsive.
          Bootstrap is developed to be mobile first, which means that the
          assumption is that users will be viewing your site on mobile.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col col-lg-3 border">
        <p>
          Bootstrap has a feature that you can use to make the column sizes
          adapt to different screen sizes. There are four different sizing terms
          that you can add to your columns:
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
