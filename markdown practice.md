To write a paragraph, you simply need to write text! If you want your text to be on a separate line, you'll need to skip a line.

No other formatting is needed to write simple paragraphs.

You can add _emphasis_ to text by wrapping the text in underscores, and you can **bold** text by adding two asterisks on either side of the bolded text.

You can add *emphasis* to text by wrapping the text in single asterisks or underscores, and you can __bold__ text by adding two asterisks or underscores on either side of the bolded text.

You can write code inline by wrapping text in a backtick. This helps distinguish the code, like `let x = 10;` from other text.

```javascript
function hello(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```
